Following are the common hdfs commands

hdfs dfs -ls < HDFS path>
hdfs dfs -copyFromLocal <Local path> <HDFS path>
hdfs dfs -copyToLocal <HDFS path> <Local Path>

hdfs dfs -rm <HDFS path for file>
hdfs dfs -rm -R <HDFS path of directory>

generally rm command simply moves hdfs files to a trash folder (.Trash)
A better way would be to actually delete the data itself  using the skipTrash argument as below

hdfs dfs -rm  -skipTrash <HDFS path for file>
hdfs dfs -rm -R -skipTrash <HDFS path of directory>

Note that the -ls command gives the size of files in bytes but one thing to note here is that it will give the size of a directory as 0 which can make us think that firectory is empty when it migt not be the case,
so to check size of directory structures, use

hdfs dfs -du -h <HDFS path>

if you want to just see the size of entire directory and not size of subdirectories , the n use

hdfs dfs -dus -h <HDFS path>
